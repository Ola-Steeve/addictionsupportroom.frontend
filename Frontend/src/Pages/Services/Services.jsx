            The NHS website has a dedicated content team. It has a clear mandate

            No member of staff will be asked, or is permitted, to provide
            favoured treatment to any partner organisation, and all staff must
            fully disclose any financial or other interests they may have in any
            healthcare-related companies or organisations. Such interests must
            be reported to the site's Content Director at the time of employment
            or at the point the interests arise thereafter.
          </p>

            The Content Director will report any potential conflict of interest
            to the Programme's Director and the Programme's Clinical Lead who
            will determine what needs to be done to eliminate it. Where content

            review high-quality evidence to make sure that content is factually

          <p>
            We are developing various new content products that are tested with
            the public before they go live. We signpost to users that these are
            prototypes and not final products. Not all the provisions of this
            policy apply to content in development.
          </p>

            The NHS website welcomes feedback on all its content. You can
            contact us through the NHS website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your feedback or complaint will be sent to our Service Desk team.
            The team will pass it to the appropriate content team member or
            clinician. Alternatively, you can email us at
            nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net.{" "}

          <p>
            In the event that a complaint cannot be resolved by a member of the
            team responsible for the NHS website, it will be escalated under NHS
            Digital's complaints procedure.
